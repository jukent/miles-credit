## WxFormer

**WxFormer** is the flagship model developed by the MILES group at NCAR.

It is a hybrid architecture that combines a CrossFormer-based encoder with a hierarchical decoder using transpose 
convolutional layers. Its structure includes U-Net-like skip connections and a pyramid layout to facilitate multi-scale 
feature representation.

CrossFormer, the foundation of WxFormer, enables long-range dependency modeling and multi-scale spatial reasoning. 
This approach has demonstrated comparable performance to other vision transformers like Swin, which forms the backbone of models such as FuXi.

WxFormer is trained to predict the atmospheric state at time step *i+1*, given the state at time *i*, typically 
with a one-hour time increment.

For further architectural details and design motivations, see **Schreck et al., 2024**.

## NCAR-FuXi

**NCAR-FuXi** is again describedd in  **Schreck et al., 2024**. FuXi, a state-of-the-art AI NWP model, was selected as the AI NWP model baseline for **Schreck et al., 2024**. The implementation of FuXi baseline follows its original design as in **Chen et al 2024**, but with reduced model sizes.

## Add Your Own Model to CREDIT

CREDIT's `register_model` decorator lets you plug any PyTorch model into the factory system without modifying the library. Once registered, your model is indistinguishable from a built-in type: `load_model` will instantiate it, and all trainer, loss, and transform machinery works as normal.

### Basic usage

Define your model class and apply `@register_model` with the type key you want to use in config files:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from credit.models import register_model


@register_model("my_model", "Loading my custom model ...")
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, hidden_dim: int = 256):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Linear(in_channels, hidden_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)
```

The first argument to `register_model` becomes the value you set for `model.type` in your YAML config. The second argument is an optional log message shown when the model is loaded. If omitted, a default message is generated from the type key.

### Matching the config signature

Constructor keyword arguments are taken directly from the `model:` block in your config, so your `__init__` signature should match the keys you put there:

```yaml
model:
  type: "my_model"
  in_channels: 128
  hidden_dim: 512
```

### Registering via the config file

The recommended way to use a custom model with the CREDIT CLI is to add a `custom_models` list at the top level of your config file. Each entry is a path to a Python file containing `@register_model`-decorated classes. CREDIT imports these files before `load_model` runs, so the type becomes available just like any built-in.

```yaml
# ---- Optional: register custom model classes ---- #
custom_models:
  - '/path/to/my_experiment/models.py'

save_loc: '/glade/derecho/scratch/$USER/CREDIT_runs/my_run'

model:
  type: "my_model"
  in_channels: 128
  hidden_dim: 512
  ...
```

Environment variables (e.g. `$WORK`, `$USER`) in the paths are expanded automatically. You can list multiple files if your experiment registers more than one custom type:

```yaml
custom_models:
  - '/path/to/my_experiment/backbone.py'
  - '/path/to/my_experiment/head.py'
```

### Registering via a Python import (alternative)

If you are calling `load_model` directly from your own script rather than using the CLI, you can register the model by importing the module that defines it before calling `load_model`:

```python
# my_experiment/train.py
import yaml
import my_experiment.models  # registers MyModel as a side-effect
from credit.models import load_model

with open("config.yml") as f:
    conf = yaml.safe_load(f)

model = load_model(conf)  # dispatches to MyModel
```

### Overwriting a built-in type

If you pass a `model_type` key that already exists in the registry (e.g. `"fuxi"`), a warning is logged and your class replaces the built-in. This is useful for swapping in a modified version of an existing architecture during experimentation without changing library code.

### Exposing `load_model` and `load_model_name` on your class

Built-in models support `load_weights=True` in `load_model` via class-level `load_model` / `load_model_name` methods. If you need checkpoint loading through the same factory call, add those methods to your class following the same convention used in `credit/models/fuxi.py`.
