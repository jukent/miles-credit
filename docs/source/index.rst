MILES-CREDIT Documentation
==========================

Welcome to the documentation for **MILES-CREDIT**, 
the **NSF NCAR Community Research Earth Digital Intelligent Twin** project. 
CREDIT is a machine learning-based research platform for understanding the best practices for training and operating global and regional AI autoregressive models, built as part of the NSF NCAR **Machine Integration and Learning for Earth Systems** (`MILES <https://ncar.github.io/miles>`_) group.

CREDIT enables users to train, run, and evaluate AI-based numerical weather and climate models. This documentation will guide you through installation, configuration, training, inference, evaluation, and extending the system with custom datasets and models.

**New here?** Start with the `Quickstart <quickstart.html>`_ — it gets you from zero to a running training job in under 10 minutes.

**What you'll find here:**

- How to install CREDIT from source
- How to set up and train a model
- How to run inference and evaluate results
- How to contribute datasets, models, and enhancements
- Config file reference for reproducible HPC runs
- Tutorial videos for visual guidance

If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. Contributions are welcome!
