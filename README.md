## About
CREDIT is an open software platform to train and deploy AI atmospheric prediction models. CREDIT offers fast models
that can be flexibly configured both in terms of input data and neural network architecture. The interface is designed
to be user-friendly and enable fast spin-up and iteration. CREDIT is backed by the AI and atmospheric science expertise
of the MILES group and the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research, leading to design choices that balance advanced
AI/ML with our physical knowledge of the atmosphere.

CREDIT has reached its first stable release with a full set of models, training, and deployment options. It continues
to be under active development. Please contact [the MILES group](mailto:milescore@ucar.edu) if you have any questions about CREDIT.

**New to CREDIT?** See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) to get up and running locally, or the [full online Quickstart](https://miles-credit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) for detailed guidance.

## AI assistant

`credit ask` is a unified AI assistant — it automatically runs in agent mode (reads your
files, runs shell commands, iterates until it has a confident answer) when an Anthropic key
is available, or falls back to simple chat (Groq, OpenRouter, Gemini, or OpenAI) otherwise.

```bash
pip install "miles-credit[ask]"

# Free — no card needed (pick either)
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...          # https://console.groq.com
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...  # https://openrouter.ai

# Or use your own Anthropic key for full agent mode (~$0.01–0.05/session)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # https://console.anthropic.com

credit ask "why is my loss not decreasing?"
credit ask -c my_run.yml "why did my training run crash?"
```

The assistant picks the first provider with an available API key. Supported keys:

| Env var | Provider / model | Mode |
|---------|------------------|------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic (Claude) | full agent mode |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq (Llama 3, free) | simple chat |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter (Qwen3-Next-80B, free) | simple chat |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google (Gemini) | simple chat |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI (GPT-4o) | simple chat |

See the [AI Assistant documentation](https://miles-credit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agent.html) for the full reference.

MILES CREDIT also provides more detailed [documentation](https://miles-credit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with installation
instructions, how to get started training and deploying models, how to interpret the config files, and full API docs.

Processed ERA5 Zarr Data are available for download through Globus (requires free account) through the [CREDIT ERA5 Zarr Files](https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/2fc90d8f-10b7-44e1-a6a5-cf844112822e/overview) collection.

Scaling/transform values for normalizing the data are available through Globus [here](https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/c5a23e21-1bee-4d1e-bb59-77c5dcee7c76). 

CREDIT also supports realtime runs generated from deterministic [Google Cloud GFS files](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/noaa-public/gfs)
and raw cube sphere [GEFS files](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/noaa-public/gfs-ensemble-forecast-system).
