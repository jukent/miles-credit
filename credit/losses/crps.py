"""Ring-reduce ensemble CRPS loss for distributed training.

One ensemble member per data-parallel rank. Member diversity comes from the
per-dp-rank RNG seed (see train_gen2: seed + data_rank) acting on stochastic
model components (dropout, SKEBS, IC perturbations); every dp rank must
receive the SAME batch, so ring-crps training disables dp dataset sharding.

    """Fair CRPS via ring communication — O(1) extra memory, no all_gather.

    Each dp rank holds 1 ensemble member of the same sample. K-1 ring shifts
    pass one member buffer at a time so rank r accumulates |x_r - x_j| for
    every j != r without ever materialising the full K-member ensemble on a
    single device.

    Gradient correctness (no cross-rank backward needed):
        d(CRPS)/d(x_r) = sign(x_r-y)/K  -  sum_{j!=r} sign(x_r-x_j) / (K*(K-1))
    Both terms are computed entirely from rank r's local graph. DDP averaging
    (1/K) then gives the correct model-parameter gradient.

    Local loss (scaled so DDP avg = d(CRPS)/d(params)):
        loss_r = |y_pred_r - y|  -  sum_{j!=r} |y_pred_r - x_j| / (K-1)

    Args:
        y_pred: Local member prediction, requires_grad. Same shape on every
            rank in the group.
        y:      Truth tensor, broadcastable against y_pred.
        group:  Process group holding one member per rank (the dp group).
            None falls back to WORLD. With K == 1 (or torch.distributed not
            initialized) the spread term vanishes and the loss reduces to MAE.

    Returns:
        Scalar loss; backward populates y_pred.grad correctly.
