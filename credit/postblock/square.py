class SquareTransform(BasePostblock):
    """Inverse of the SqrtTransform preblock: converts sqrt-space values to physical space.

    Inverts ``y = sqrt(x)`` back to ``x = y^2``.

    Note: values may be slightly negative due to floating-point effects; squaring maps
    these to small positive numbers. Clamping to zero is intentionally avoided to
    preserve gradient flow if this postblock is ever connected to a differentiable loss.

    ``variables`` supports the same shorthand as the scaler: an empty list
    transforms every variable; partial paths (e.g. ``"era5/prognostic"``) expand
    to all variables under that hierarchy. Expansion happens lazily on the first
    forward call.
