grid_utils.py
-------------
Everything about horizontal grid geometry for gen2: coordinate-pair detection,
rectilinear-vs-curvilinear classification, and GridSchema (the real-coordinate
contract for output, mirroring ChannelSchema in channel_utils.py).

find_coord_pair / infer_grid_type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Small, dependency-free helpers for locating a lon/lat coordinate pair in an
``xr.Dataset`` (by name) and classifying it as rectilinear (1D) or curvilinear
(2D). Used by the per-dataset grid detection in ``local.py``/``era5.py``, and
by ``credit.grid.scrip_from_netcdf`` (SCRIP-format grid generation for ESMF
regridding) — this is the shared home for both rather than duplicating the
logic in each.

GridSchema
~~~~~~~~~~
``ForecastWriter`` previously fabricated output lat/lon from
``model.image_height``/``image_width`` via a global ``[-90, 90] x [0, 360)``
linspace — wrong for regional domains and for curvilinear sources (e.g. HRRR),
which need a real 2D lat/lon field, not a fabricated 1D one. There is no
fabricated fallback anywhere in this pipeline anymore: if a real grid can't be
found or resolved, callers raise rather than guess.

Two distinct grid concepts:

* **Native input grid** — each dataset class (``LocalDataset``, ``era5.py``,
  ``goes.py``, ``hrrr.py``) exposes the real lat/lon it read from its own files
  via ``self.static_metadata["grid"]`` (a debugging aid, inspectable directly
  on the live dataset — not necessarily what ends up in the output file). The
  same dataset class also best-effort persists it to
  ``{save_loc}/{source}_grid_schema.nc`` the moment it's known, via
  ``write_source_grid_schema_if_missing`` — including from inside a DataLoader
  worker subprocess, which has filesystem access even though it can't
  propagate Python object state back to the main training process.
* **Resolved output grid** — what ``ForecastWriter`` actually writes. The
  model produces one flat tensor at one fixed ``(H, W)``, so there is exactly
  one output grid per run: the (single, in practice) source's native grid,
  overridden by an active ``Regridder`` preblock's real destination grid when
  regridding is in play (the common case where regridding is *not* used is
  the default: the native grid passes straight through unchanged).

Lifecycle
^^^^^^^^^
Training/rollout setup resolves the schema once — via ``GridSchema.resolve``
using the live dataset + preblocks (with a disk fallback to each source's
``{source}_grid_schema.nc`` when the live process never saw the data itself)
— and, only when an active ``Regridder`` actually changes the grid, saves the
result to ``{save_loc}/output_grid_schema.nc`` (skipped when no regridder is
active: the single source's own file already *is* the effective output grid,
so a second identical copy would be pure duplication). Later runs (or a
re-run without training) load whichever file is present instead of
re-resolving, via ``GridSchema.load_or_resolve``.

Scope: rectilinear and curvilinear only (no unstructured). Projection/CRS
metadata (e.g. HRRR's Lambert Conformal Conic) is deferred to a follow-on —
plain lat/lon coordinates are CF-valid on their own.
