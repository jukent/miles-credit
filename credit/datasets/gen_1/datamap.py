"""datamap.py
--------------------------------------------------

The xarray library can be slow on very large datasets, so we need to
manage data manually when training ML models.  A datamap object
performs many of the same functions as an xarray.Dataset (not to be
confused with a torch.utils.data.Dataset), but drops a lot of
functionality and checking so it's faster.

A datamap provides a list-like interface to a set of netcdf files,
virtually concatenating them along the time dimension.  It tracks
which index values live in which file, and lazily opens files and
reads data only for the requested indexes.  It also can interconvert
datetimes and indexes.

NOTE: the datamap object assumes that:

1) The time coordinates are uniformly spaced and have no gaps (i.e.,
after setup, it only tracks how many timesteps are in each file, not
the actual values of the time coordinate)

2) Lexicographic sort of the filenames is equivalent to chronological
ordering of the data.  This is true if the filesnames are uniformly
named except for a time element, and that the time element is ISO-8601
(YYYY-MM-DD etc.)

3) Contents of the files are uniform.  All of the variables in the
datamap have the same dimensionality, and all variables exist in each
file.

4) The time dimension has a coordinate variable with the attributes
'axis', 'calendar', and 'units' set to the appropriate CF-compliant
values.

# The following table illustrates the indexing problem that the
# DataMap class solves.  Suppose we have a dataset of daily data
# organized into monthly files.  For reasons (e.g., a t/t/v split),
# we're using a subset of the data specified by a first and last date
# of 2000-12-22 through 2001-12-21 (winter solstice).  We're training
# using 3 timesteps of history and 2 timesteps of forecast, for a
# total sample length of 5.  The time coordinates of the data are
# stored netcdf-style as minutes since 2000-01-01.  The effective
# length of this dataset is 361 samples.

# If the dataset is large, you don't want to read everything into
# memory; you want to load data lazily when it's needed.  This can be
# done using xarray -- unless the dataset consists of a very large
# number of netcdf files.  The xarray.open_mfdataset() method uses the
# netcdf4.open_mfdata() method, which becomes unusably slow when the
# number of files is large.  You can avoid this problem if you convert
# the data to zarr, but if the way you normally convert netcdf to zarr
# is via xarray, you're stuck in the same bind.  You can concatenate
# the netcdf files together into a smaller number of files, but that,
# too, can be impractically slow if the chunking is bad and you don't
# use all the correct magical incantations to speed up concatenation.

# Some tests show that in an HPC environment, netcdf can outperform
# zarr, especially if the data is organized inside the file and
# chunked in a way that matches the way the data will be read.  So we
# need code that will combine a large number of netcdf files into a
# single virtual dataset with an index-based interface that lazily
# loads the data on demand.  That's what the DataMap class does,
# without using open_mfdataset() and without all the overhead of
# building xarray indexes.

# Going back to the example, a call to __getitem__(8) (or dmap[8])
# will open up files 0 and 1 (2000-12 and 2001-01) and read timesteps
# 29-30 of the former and 0-2 of the latter, and combine and return
# them as a 5-timestep sample.

# The leftmost column of the table is the time index, which is the
# number of the timestep within the concatenated collection of netcdf
# files.  If you have a list of the last time indexes in each file,
# you can np.searchsorted to find which file it it's in; you then
# subtract the first time index in that file (= last time index of
# previous file + 1) to get the index of the timestep within the file.
# The time index also has a linear relationsip with the time
# coordinate (multiply by dt and add the offset from epoch), and you
# can convert the time coordinate to/from a date using the cftime
# library.  The rightmost column is the sample index, which is the
# number of the sample with that timestep as the first forecast
# sample, taking into consideration the starting point of the split
# and the number of historical timesteps in the split (since a full
# sample has to fit entirely within the split).  The sample index is
# the timestep index minus an offset, which is the timestep index of
# the first timestep in the split and minus the number of historical
# timesteps.

# Time index is the numbering that gets used internally to find data
# within files.  Sample index is the numbering that's exposed to the
# outside world via __getitem__.
